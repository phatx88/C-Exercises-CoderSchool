//Part 1
//Write a C# program that concatenates two strings (player's first and last name) and then outputs the result.
//Hint: You can assign a string to a variable using the = operator.
//Hint: You can use the + operator to concatenate two strings.
//Hint: You can use the Console.WriteLine() method to output the result.
//string playerFirstName, playerLastName;
//playerFirstName = "John";
//playerLastName = "Ullysee";
//Console.WriteLine($"player name : {playerFirstName +" "+ playerLastName}");


//Part 2
//Modify the program so that it gets the two strings from the user(for username).
//Hint: You can use the Console.ReadLine() method to get a string from the user.
//Hint: You can use the Console.WriteLine() method to prompt the user for input.
//Hint: You can use the Console.WriteLine() method to output the result.
//Console.WriteLine("Please enter your first name: ");
//string playerFirstName = Console.ReadLine();
//Console.WriteLine("Please enter your last name: ");
//string playerLastName = Console.ReadLine();
//Console.WriteLine($"your name is : {playerFirstName + " " + playerLastName}");



//Part 3
//Modify the program so that it concatenates three strings instead of two (clan name).
//Hint: You can use the + operator to concatenate three strings.
//Hint: You can use the Console.WriteLine() method to output the result.
//Console.WriteLine("Please enter your first name: ");
//string playerFirstName = Console.ReadLine();
//Console.WriteLine("Please enter your last name: ");
//string playerLastName = Console.ReadLine();
//Console.WriteLine("Please enter your clan name: ");
//string playerClanName = Console.ReadLine();
//Console.WriteLine($"your name is : {playerFirstName + " " + playerLastName + " of clan " + playerClanName}");


//Part 4
//Modify the program to concatenate a string and an integer(incase,player name had numebrs).
//Hint: You can use the + operator to concatenate a string and an integer.
//Hint: You can use the Console.ReadLine() method to get an integer from the user.
//Hint: You can use the int.Parse() method to convert a string to an integer.
//Hint: You can use the Console.WriteLine() method to output the result.
Console.WriteLine("Please enter your first name: ");
string playerFirstName = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine("Please enter your last name: ");
string playerLastName = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine("Please enter your age: ");
int playerAge = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine($"your name is : {playerFirstName + " " + playerLastName + " of age " + playerAge}");
